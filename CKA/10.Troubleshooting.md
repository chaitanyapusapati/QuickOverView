# Application Failure

  - In this lecture we will go step by step in troubleshooting Application failure.

  - To check the Application/Service status of the webserver

    ```
    curl http://web-service-ip:node-port
    ```

  - To check the endpoint of the service and compare it with the selectors

    ```
    kubectl describe service web-service
    ```   

    
  - To check the status and logs of the pod

    ```
    kubectl get pod
    ```

    ```
    kubectl describe pod web
    ```

    ```
    kubectl logs web
    ```

  - To check the logs of the previous pod

    ```
    kubectl logs web -f --previous
    ```

  # Control Plane Failure

  - In this lecture we will use how to troubleshoot the Control Plane components.

  - To check the status of the nodes if they are healthy

    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

  - To check the status of the pods if the are running

    ```
    kubectl get pods
    ```

  - To check the status of all the pods of the Control Plane components(if they are deployed with kubeadm tool) and make sure they are **`Running`**

    ```
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system
    ```

  - If the Control Plane components are deployed as services then check the status of all the components

  - To check the status of **`kube-apiserver`** 

    ```
    service kube-apiserver status
    ```

  - To check the status of **`kube-controller-manager`** 

    ```
    service kube-controller-manager status
    ```

  - To check the status of **`kube-scheduler`** 

    ```
    service kube-scheduler status
    ```

  - To check the status of **`kubelet`** 

    ```
    service kubelet status
    ```

  - To check the status of **`kube-proxy`** on the worker nodes.

    ```
    service kube-proxy status
    ```

  - To check the logs of the Control Plane components deployed as Pods:

    ```
    kubectl logs kube-apiserver-master -n kube-system
    ```

  - To check the logs of the Control Plane components deployed as SystemD Service

    ```
    sudo journalctl -u kube-apiserver
    ```

# Worker Node Failure

  - Lets check the status of the Nodes in the cluster, are they **`Ready`** or **`NotReady`**

    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

  - If they are **`NotReady`** then check the **`LastHeartbeatTime`** of the node to find out the time when node might have crashed

    ```
    kubectl describe node worker-1
    ```

  - Check the possible **`CPU`** and **`MEMORY`**  using **`top`** and **`df -h`** 

  - Check the status and the logs of the **`kubelet`** for the possible issues.

    ```
    serivce kubelet status
    ```

    ```
    sudo journalctl â€“u kubelet
    ```
    
  - Check the **`kubelet`** Certificates, they are not expired, and in the right group and issued by the right CA.

    ```
    openssl x509 -in /var/lib/kubelet/worker-1.crt -text
    ```
